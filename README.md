# Pattern Printing 

This project is a **Pattern Printing P** implemented in C++ that generates a number pattern based on user input. It takes the number of rows from the user, validates the input, and then prints a symmetric pattern with alternating `1`s and `0`s.

---

## Features
- **Input Validation:** Ensures the user input is a positive integer, not zero or negative.
- **Pattern Generation:** Prints a custom number pattern based on the input rows.
- **Odd and Even Rows Handling:** Differentiates between even and odd row inputs for proper pattern formatting.
- **Dynamic Pattern Size:** The pattern adjusts dynamically based on the number of rows entered by the user.

---

## Technologies Used
- **C++** for logic and input handling.
- **Standard Library:** Uses string manipulation (`<cstring>`) and input/output (`<iostream>`).

---

## How to Use
1. Compile and run the C++ program.
2. The program will prompt you to enter the number of rows for the pattern.
3. After validating the input, the program will generate and print the pattern.
4. The program handles both even and odd row inputs and adjusts the pattern accordingly.

---

## Customization
- Modify the pattern logic in functions like `printNumbers` or `printTopPattern` to change number sequences or spacing.
- You can extend the program to support more complex patterns or input formats.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Implement graphical output to visualize the pattern.
- Add support for different types of number patterns (e.g., Fibonacci, prime numbers).
- Enable saving the generated pattern to a file.
